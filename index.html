        <img id="psu1" src="./images/psu_1.jpg" alt="Image of a Power Supply Unit">
        A power supply converts <b> alternating current (AC) </b> to <b> direct current (DC) </b>, which is
        which
        they need computer components to function. Unlike some
        Hardware components whose use is not mandatory, the power supply <b> is
          a crucial piece </b> because without it, the rest of the internal hardware cannot function.
        Power supply is often abbreviated as <b> PSU </b> (from <b> Power Supply Unit </b>).
      </p>


      <p>
        This component mounts to the rear of the box or chassis.
        The side of the power supply that faces the outside of the case has a three-prong male port
        into which a <b> power cable </b> is plugged in and the other end is connected directly to the outlet
        current.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img id="psu7" src="./images/psu_6.jpg" alt="Image of the backpart of a Power Supply Unit">
        Inside the PC, a large number of cables run from the source. The connectors located on
        opposite ends of the cables connect to various components within the computer to <b>supply themenergy </b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Power supplies are rated by <b> watts (W) </b> to show how much power they can
        provide to
        computer. Since <b> each part of the computer requires a certain amount of energy to function </b>
        correctly, it is important <b> to have a power supply that can provide the correct amount</b>.
      </p>

      <!--Section 3: How does it works-->
      <h1>How does it works</h1>
      <p>
        <img id="psu8" src="./images/psu_7.jpg" alt="PSU insides">
        The Power Supply Unit is a <b> vital component </b> for the operation of the computer.
        Power supplies use switching technology to convert current input
        alternating current, about 220 volts, at lower direct current voltages. The most used voltages are:
      <ul>
        <li> <b> 3,3 </b> volts</li>
        <li> <b> 5 </b> volts </li>
        <li> <b> 12 </b> volts</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Nowadays about 90% or 95% of the load is on the <b> 12V rail </b>. Therefore, the other rails
      they remain in an increasingly secondary position.
      The <b> wattage </b> of a power supply is always shown in <b> watts (W) </b>. A watt is the product of
      the voltage in volts and the current in amps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, a computer is turned on with a small button and turned off with a menu option or with the
        own button. These options were built into the standard PSU several years ago.
        In this way, the operating system is able to send a signal to the PSU in order to indicate that it is
        turn off. The pushbutton sends a <b> 5 volts </b> signal to the power supply to tell it <b> when to
          light up </b>.
        The power supply also has a circuit that supplies stand-by power, called <b> 5VSB (5
          volts stand by) </b>, even when the computer is turned off, so that devices that remain
        on standby can work and the source can be turned on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power supplies in use today are much <b> lighter and smaller </b> compared to the
        great
        weight and bulkiness of their ancestors. They transform the
        <b> 60 Hz (cycles per second) </b> current at a much higher frequency, resulting in more
        cycles
        per second. This conversion allows a small and lightweight transformer in the power supply to do the
        <b> real voltage reduction of 220V </b> (in Europe and most of the world) to the <b> voltage necessary to
          saying
          particular component </b>.

        <h1>
          Keys for choosing a PSU
        </h1>
        <p>
          To choose a power supply correctly you must take into account three main
          concepts: <b> power </b>, <b> amperage </b> and <b> efficiency </b>.
        <ul>
          <li><b> Power and amperage </b>: Power is measured in <b> watts (W) </b> and is the main criterion that
            follow users to
            When choosing a certain power supply for your computer. It is correct since it is a <b> value to
              have
              note </b>, but the problem is that in many cases <b> it is not displayed realistically </b> and <b>
              I do not know
              complements
              appropriately with amperage </b>, and the <b> consequences </b> of this can be <b> dire </b>.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><b> Efficiency </b>: it is a concept that in power supplies is defined as <b> electrical energy
              lost in
              form of heat </b> produced by the work of said component itself, that is, the <b> power
              that loses
              What
              natural consequence of its own functioning </b>. Efficency is rated by the <b> 80 plus certification</b>,
            that goes from 80 plus common to titanium rating. Also, efficency <b> depends on the PSU load in that
              moment</b>, normally being the most efficent at <b> 50% of its load</b>.</li>
